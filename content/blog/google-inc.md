## Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra

The camera system on the Galaxy S21 Ultra is the best I've used on any Android phone and is extremely
competitive with the iPhone 12 Pro Max. And with telephoto shots, it usually wins outright. Dynamic range 
isn't bad. Portrait Mode has the usual hair foibles but a nice bokeh drop-off.
